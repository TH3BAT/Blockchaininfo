# **₿itcoin Node Metrics Overview** 🛰️⚡  

**Blockchaininfo** gives you a **real-time pulse** on Bitcoin’s network health, decentralization, and security. Every metric tells a story—of blocks, transactions, miners, and nodes keeping the network alive.  

---

## **⛓️ Blockchain Metrics: The Network's Pulse**  

### **📌 Chain Status**  

- **Active Chain**: The network your node is tracking (e.g., `main`, `test`).  
- **Best Block**: The most recent block mined.  
- **Time Since Last Block**: How fresh the last block is—key for detecting irregularities.  

### **⚒️ Mining & Difficulty**  

- **Current Difficulty**: How tough it is to mine a block.  
- **Blocks Until Adjustment**: Countdown to the next difficulty shift.  
- **Projected Difficulty Change**: Up or down? See where mining pressure is heading.  

### **🔗 Chain Integrity & Verification**  

- **Total Chainwork**: A raw power indicator—the total computational work securing Bitcoin.  
- **Verification Progress**: How much of the blockchain has been validated.  

### **🗂️ Storage & Consensus Timekeeping**  

- **Blockchain Size**: Disk usage—essential for node maintenance.  
- **Median Time**: Time calculated from the last 11 blocks—critical for consensus.  
- **Block Timestamp**: The latest heartbeat from Bitcoin’s timekeeping mechanism.

## **🚀 Mempool Metrics: The Waiting Room**  

### **📨 Transaction Flow**  

- **Unconfirmed Transactions**: The number of TXs waiting to be mined.  
- **Mempool Memory Usage**: How much space these transactions occupy.  
- **Total Fees in Mempool**: A live snapshot of fees waiting to be collected.  
- **Minimum Fee Rate**: The floor rate required to enter the mempool.  

📝 *Why It Matters*: A busy mempool signals network congestion. Low fees? Cheap transactions. High fees? Time to outbid the crowd.

## **🌐 Network Metrics: The Node’s Eyes & Ears**  

### **🖧 Peer Connectivity**  

- **Inbound Peers**: Other nodes connecting to you.  
- **Outbound Peers**: The nodes your node reaches out to.  

### **📡 Data Flow & Propagation**  

- **Total Bytes Received**: The volume of data your node ingests.  
- **Total Bytes Sent**: The amount your node shares with the network.  

### **📊 Node Version Distribution**  

Tracking the software versions of your peers gives insight into decentralization and upgrade trends.  

```yaml
Node Version Distribution:
  - v27.1.0: 9 peers  
  - v28.0.0: 8 peers  
  - v26.0.0: 7 peers  
```

📝 *Why It Matters*: Version diversity is resilience. If everyone runs the same version, an exploit could cripple the network.

## **🔐 Consensus Security: Guarding Bitcoin’s Truth**  

### **⚠️ Fork Monitoring**  

- **Fork Height**: Block height where a chain divergence occurs.  
- **Fork Status**: Is it active, stale, or a potential threat?  
- **Branch Length**: How far a fork has split from the main chain.  

### **📈 Block Propagation Speed**  

- Tracks how fast blocks spread across the network—key for decentralization and mining fairness.
