## Requirements

### Configuration

The application requires Bitcoin Core RPC credentials to function properly. These credentials can be provided in one of the following ways:

1. **`config.toml` File (Default)**  
   Create a `config.toml` file in the same directory blockchaininfo will reside.
         Default is ./target/release/
   with the following structure:

   ```toml
   [bitcoin_rpc]
   username = "your_username"
   password = "your_password"
   address = "http://127.0.0.1:8332"
   ```

   Replace the values with your actual Bitcoin Core RPC credentials.

2. **Environment Variables (Alternative)**  
   If `config.toml` is not provided, the application will look for the following environment variables:
   - `RPC_USER`: Your Bitcoin Core RPC username
   - `RPC_PASSWORD`: Your Bitcoin Core RPC password
   - `RPC_ADDRESS`: The Bitcoin Core RPC server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8332`, `https://your-node.local`)

3. **macOS Keychain (Preferred for macOS)**  
   On macOS, you can securely store the RPC password in the system Keychain. This is the most secure and recommended method. To set it up:
   - Use the following command to add the password to your Keychain:

     ```bash
     security add-generic-password -a bitcoin -s rpc-password -w "your_password"
     ```

   - The program will automatically retrieve the password using the Keychain during runtime. Ensure the username (`RPC_USER`) and address (`RPC_ADDRESS`) are provided either in the `config.toml` file or as environment variables.

4. **Rust (Stable)**  
   - Install Rust via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

## Error Handling

The program includes robust error handling:

- **Configuration Errors**: Ensures `config.toml` or environment variables contains valid credentials and address.
- **RPC Communication Errors**: Handles failures in connecting to the Bitcoin node.  
- **Data Parsing Errors**: Identifies and reports issues with parsing the JSON response.
